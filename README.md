# KOPFHÖREN
Interactive Touchdesigner project with cv2 facetracking and ableton connection.

Project was coded and tested on MacOS, no gurantee for Windows! </br>

**Touchdesigner Build 2022.29850**

### SETUP
1. Setup a Pyhton environment on your computer </br> 
(I recommend using a specific anaconda env for all TD projects)
2. pip install *opencv-python, numpy* and *dlib* on that env
3. Link your pyhton env in *Preferences/General* in "Python 64-bit Module Path"</br>
(e.g. /opt/anaconda3/envs/Touchdesigner/lib/python3.9/site-packages)

### RUN PROJECT
1. Open the Ableton Project *ableton/"hören-connect Project"* 
2. Open hören.toe
3. Wait for ableton to connect, if not check error messages in console
4. Click on Button of *VIDEO_IN_FACETRACKING* container to get the camera and facetracking started
5. Play around with visuals and sound! Have Fun!
